Interpreter Design Pattern in C#
In this article, I am going to discuss the Interpreter Design Pattern in C# with examples.
Please read our previous article where we discussed the Strategy Design Pattern in C# with
real-time examples. The Interpreter Design Pattern falls under the category of Behavioural 
Design Pattern. As part of this article, we are going to discuss the following pointers in
detail.

When to use the Interpreter Design Pattern?
What is the Interpreter Design Pattern?
The Interpreter Design Pattern Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression.
This pattern is used in SQL parsing, symbol processing engine, etc.

Let us understand the interpreter design pattern with an example. Please have a look at 
the following image. On the left-hand side, you can see the Context. The Context is nothing 
but the value that we want to interpret. Here, the context value is the current date. 
On the right-hand side, you can see the Date expression or you can say the grammar.
We have different types of date expression such as (MM-DD-YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, 
and DD-YYYY).

Context: This is a class that contains the data that we want to interpret.

AbstractExpression: This is either an interface that defines the interpret method 
	which should be implemented by the subclasses. This method takes the context object
	as a parameter. This context object holds the data that we want to interpret.

TerminalExpression: This is a concrete class that implements the Interpret abstract method 
of the AbstractExpression interface. The Terminal Expression represents elements in 
the grammar that do not get replace such as symbols.

NonTerminalExpression: This is also a concrete class that implements the AbstractExpression
interface. The NonTerminalExpression represents elements that will be replaced during 
the evaluation such as variables or even rules.

Client: This is a class that builds the abstract syntax tree for a set of instructions 
in the given grammar. This tree builds with the help of instances of NonTerminalExpression 
and TerminalExpression classes.
