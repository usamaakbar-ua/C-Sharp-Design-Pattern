The State design pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. 
The object will appear to change its class.


Frequency of use: 3/5  medium



The classes and objects participating in this pattern include:

Context  (Account)
-defines the interface of interest to clients
-maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.

State  (State)
-defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.

Concrete State  (RedState, SilverState, GoldState)
-each subclass implements a behavior associated with a state of Context
