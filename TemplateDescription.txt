The Template Method design pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. 
This pattern lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm‘s structure.

C# Design Patterns


AbstractClass  (DataObject)
	*defines abstract primitive operations that concrete subclasses define to implement steps of an algorithm
	*implements a template method defining the skeleton of an algorithm. The template method calls primitive operations as well as operations defined in AbstractClass or those of other objects.
ConcreteClass  (CustomerDataObject)
	*implements the primitive operations to carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm
